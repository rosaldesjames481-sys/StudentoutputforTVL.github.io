  <h1>About the Website</h1>
  <p>
    This website was developed as a web-based system prototype intended to
    showcase selected student outputs from the Technical-Vocational Livelihood (TVL)
    strand of Alimodian National Comprehensive High School.
  </p>
  <p>
    The platform serves as a digital repository and promotional tool that highlights
    students’ competencies, creativity, and hands-on skills acquired through
    outcome-based education.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project was created by TVL ICT students as part of an academic and research
    requirement aligned with Information and Communications Technology specialization.
